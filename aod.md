Worked for a large airline, directly with product owners, stakeholders, and other cross functional teams; gathering business requirements, obtaining wireframes and UX comps, architecting the tech stack(Angular, Material, Node.js, Upstash Redis, and Vercel), drafting and tracking epics, stories and (sub)task(Jira and Git integration). My initial PoC's were taken directly to production by the client which then served customers on a global scale during the pandemic. We used a combination of Quantum Metric and Datadog to track analytics and customer interaction data, optimizing features as needed. I led scrums for a small offshore team of 2 other developers and 2 other qa resources. I performed complex integration and development task, code reviews, merged pull request from our qa environment branch to a production environment branch, code quality and security scanning, and other essential CI/CD setup task using Docker, Bash, Artifactory, Sonarcube and Teamcity. I then migrated the SPA, the NoSQL based customer queue, the domain's DNS records, and it's coresponding API's which used IBM's Datapower Oauth2 service and a custom time based server/client XSRF encryption algorithm from my Vercel PaaS instances to their internal AWS stack using AWS ALB, Route53, Cloudformation, Lambda, EKS, Cloudwatch, and Cloudtrail with Datadog integration.
